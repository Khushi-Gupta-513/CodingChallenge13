Product Webpage Project

This project is a simple product listing webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing how to work with the Fetch API and Promises to load data dynamically. The page retrieves product information, including the product name, company, price, and image, from an external API and displays it in a user-friendly format. Error handling is implemented to display a message if the data fails to load. This project demonstrates essential skills for managing asynchronous operations with `.then()` and `.catch()`, dynamically creating HTML elements, and using CSS for layout styling.
